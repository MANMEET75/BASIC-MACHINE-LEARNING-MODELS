   - Techniques for discovering interesting relations between variables in large databases.
### 24. Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
   - A class of feedforward artificial neural network that consists of at least three layers of nodes.
### 25. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
   - A method used in statistics and machine learning to find a linear combination of features that characterizes or separates two or more classes of objects or events.
### 26. Independent Component Analysis (ICA)
   - A computational method for separating a multivariate signal into additive, independent non-Gaussian signals.
### 27. Word2Vec
   - A group of related models that are used to produce word embeddings, used in natural language processing (NLP).

   - An extension of Word2Vec that learns to produce vectors for pieces of texts, such as sentences, paragraphs, or entire documents.
###  29. Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)
   - A statistical measure used to evaluate the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents.
###  30. Self-Organizing Maps (SOM)
   - A type of artificial neural network trained using unsupervised learning to produce a low-dimensional representation of the input space.
###  31. Time Series Analysis
   - Techniques for analyzing time series data in order to extract meaningful statistics and identify characteristics of the data.
###  32. Anomaly Detection
   - Techniques for identifying rare items, events, or observations that raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data.
